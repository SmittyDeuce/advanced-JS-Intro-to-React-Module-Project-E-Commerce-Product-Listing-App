üìå Project Overview
In this project, students will build a simple E-Commerce Product
Listing App using React. This project reinforces React components,
props, and state by designing a layout without using frameworks like
Bootstrap, focusing on custom styling.

‚ú® Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, students will be able to:
    ‚úÖ Organize code using React components.
    
    ‚úÖ Manage state using the useState hook.
    
    ‚úÖ Pass and manage data through props between components.
    
    ‚úÖ Structure a React application with a parent-child component hierarchy.
Note: Students will not be using event handling yet, but this 
project sets the foundation for it in later lessons.
